To run the following program, simply run the sequence_alignment.py through the CMD or some IDE and call one of three functions:
- dynprog
- dynproglin
- heuralign

Requirements:
- Python 3.7.4 installed (or higher)

Extra: To change parameters for the heuristic alignment algorithm (FASTA), update various lines in the code:
- ktup = line 480
- diagonalWidth = line 481

Changing these will produce different outputs for the heuristic algorithm
